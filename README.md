## The Problem with Swift's Error Protocol

Swift's `Error` protocol is simple â€“ too simple. While it has no requirements, it provides a computed property `localizedDescription` that's commonly used for logging errors and displaying messages to users. However, this simplicity leads to unexpected behavior and confusion.

Consider this example of providing a `localizedDescription` for an error enum:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error, CaseIterable {
   case noConnectionToServer
   case parsingFailed

   var localizedDescription: String {
      switch self {
      case .noConnectionToServer: "No connection to the server."
      case .parsingFailed: "Data parsing failed."
      }
   }
}
```

You might expect this to work seamlessly, but trying it out reveals a surprise: ðŸ˜±

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
   var body: some View {
      Button("Throw Random NetworkError") {
         do {
            throw NetworkError.allCases.randomElement()!
         } catch {
            print("Caught error with message: \(error.localizedDescription)")
         }
      }
   }
}
```

The console output is not what you'd expect:

```bash
Caught error with message: The operation couldn't be completed. (ErrorKitDemo.NetworkError error 0.)
```

There's no information about the specific error case - not even the enum case name appears, let alone your custom message! This happens because Swift's `Error` protocol is bridged to `NSError`, which uses a different system of `domain`, `code`, and `userInfo`.

### The "Correct" Way: `LocalizedError`

Swift provides `LocalizedError` as the "proper" solution, with these optional properties:
- `errorDescription: String?`
- `failureReason: String?`
- `recoverySuggestion: String?`
- `helpAnchor: String?`

However, this approach has serious issues:
- All properties are optional - no compiler enforcement
- Only `errorDescription` affects `localizedDescription`
- `failureReason` and `recoverySuggestion` are often ignored
- `helpAnchor` is rarely used in modern development

This makes `LocalizedError` both confusing and error-prone.

## The Throwable Protocol Solution

ErrorKit introduces the `Throwable` protocol to solve these issues:

```swift
public protocol Throwable: LocalizedError {
   var userFriendlyMessage: String { get }
}
```

This protocol is simple and clear:
- Named to align with Swift's `throw` keyword
- Follows Swift's naming convention (`able` suffix like `Codable`)
- Requires single, non-optional `userFriendlyMessage` property
- Guarantees your errors behave as expected

Here's how you use it:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Throwable {
   case noConnectionToServer
   case parsingFailed

   var userFriendlyMessage: String {
      switch self {
      case .noConnectionToServer: String(localized: "Unable to connect to the server.")
      case .parsingFailed: String(localized: "Data parsing failed.")
      }
   }
}
```

When you print `error.localizedDescription`, you'll get exactly the message you expect! ðŸ¥³

### Quick Start During Development

During early development phases when you're rapidly prototyping, `Throwable` allows you to define error messages using raw values for maximum speed:

```swift
enum NetworkError: String, Throwable {
   case noConnectionToServer = "Unable to connect to the server."
   case parsingFailed = "Data parsing failed."
}
```

This approach eliminates boilerplate code while keeping error definitions concise and descriptive. However, remember to transition to proper localization using `String(localized:)` before shipping your app.

### Summary

> Conform your custom error types to `Throwable` instead of `Error` or `LocalizedError`. The `Throwable` protocol requires only `userFriendlyMessage: String`, ensuring your error messages are exactly what you expect â€“ no surprises.

## Enhanced Error Descriptions with `userFriendlyMessage(for:)`

ErrorKit enhances error clarity through the `ErrorKit.userFriendlyMessage(for:)` function, designed to provide improved error descriptions for any error type.

### How It Works

The `userFriendlyMessage(for:)` function analyzes the provided `Error` and returns an enhanced message that's clear and helpful. It leverages a community-maintained collection of descriptions to ensure messages are accurate and continuously improving.

### Supported Error Domains

ErrorKit provides enhanced messages for errors from various domains:
- Foundation
- CoreData
- MapKit
- And many more...

These domains are continuously updated to provide coverage for the most common error types in Swift development.

### Usage Example

Here's how to use `userFriendlyMessage(for:)` to handle errors gracefully:

```swift
do {
    // Attempt a network request
    let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")!
    let _ = try Data(contentsOf: url)
} catch {
    // Print or show the enhanced error message to a user
    print(ErrorKit.userFriendlyMessage(for: error))
    // Example output: "You are not connected to the Internet. Please check your connection."
}
```

### Why Use `userFriendlyMessage(for:)`?

- **Clarity**: Returns clear and concise error messages, avoiding cryptic system-generated descriptions
- **Consistency**: Provides standardized error messaging across your application
- **Community-Driven**: Messages are regularly improved through developer contributions
- **Comprehensive**: Covers a wide range of common Swift error scenarios

## Overloads of Common System Functions with Typed Throws

ErrorKit introduces typed-throws overloads for common system APIs like `FileManager` and `URLSession`, providing more granular error handling and improved code clarity. These overloads allow you to handle specific error scenarios with tailored responses, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.

### Discovery and Usage

To streamline discovery, ErrorKit uses the same API names prefixed with `throwable`. These functions throw specific errors that conform to `Throwable`, allowing for clear and informative error messages.

**Enhanced User-Friendly Error Messages:**

One of the key advantages of ErrorKit's typed throws is the improved `localizedDescription` property. This property provides user-friendly error messages that are tailored to the specific error type. This eliminates the need for manual error message construction and ensures a consistent and informative user experience.

**Example: Creating a Directory**

```swift
do {
  try FileManager.default.throwableCreateDirectory(at: URL(string: "file:///path/to/directory")!)
} catch {
   switch error {
   case FileManagerError.noWritePermission:
      // Request write permission from the user instead of showing error message
   default:
      // Common error cases have a more descriptive message
      showErrorDialog(error.localizedDescription)
   }
}
```

The code demonstrates how to handle errors for specific error cases with an improved UX rather than just showing an error message to the user, which can still be the fallback. And the error cases are easy to discover thanks to the typed enum error.

**Example: Handling network request errors**

```swift
do {
  let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.throwableData(from: URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data")!)
  // Process the data and response
} catch {
  // Error is of type `URLSessionError`
  print(error.localizedDescription)

  switch error {
  case .timeout, .requestTimeout, .tooManyRequests:
    // Automatically retry the request with a backoff strategy
  case .noNetwork:
    // Show an SF Symbol indicating the user is offline plus a retry button
  case .unauthorized:
    // Redirect the user to your login-flow (e.g. because token expired)
  default:
    // Fall back to showing error message
  }
}
```

Here, the code leverages the specific error types to implement various kinds of custom logic. This demonstrates the power of typed throws in providing fine-grained control over error handling.

### Summary

By utilizing these typed-throws overloads, you can write more robust and maintainable code. ErrorKit's enhanced user-friendly messages and ability to handle specific errors with code lead to a better developer and user experience. As the library continues to evolve, we encourage the community to contribute additional overloads and error types for common system APIs to further enhance its capabilities.

## Built-in Error Types for Common Scenarios

ErrorKit provides a set of pre-defined error types for common scenarios that developers encounter frequently. These built-in types conform to `Throwable` and can be used with both typed throws (`throws(DatabaseError)`) and classical throws declarations.

### Why Built-in Types?

Built-in error types offer several advantages:
- **Quick Start**: Begin with well-structured error handling without defining custom types
- **Consistency**: Use standardized error cases and messages across your codebase
- **Flexibility**: Easily transition to custom error types when you need more specific cases
- **Discoverability**: Clear naming conventions make it easy to find the right error type
- **Localization**: All error messages are pre-localized and user-friendly
- **Ecosystem Impact**: As more Swift packages adopt these standardized error types, apps can implement smarter error handling that works across dependencies. Instead of just showing error messages, apps could provide specific UI or recovery actions for known error types, creating a more cohesive error handling experience throughout the ecosystem.

### Available Error Types

ErrorKit includes the following built-in error types:

- **DatabaseError** (connectionFailed, operationFailed, recordNotFound)
- **FileError** (fileNotFound, readFailed, writeFailed)
- **NetworkError** (noInternet, timeout, badRequest, serverError, decodingFailure)
- **OperationError** (dependencyFailed, canceled, unknownFailure)
- **ParsingError** (invalidInput, missingField, inputTooLong)
- **PermissionError** (denied, restricted, notDetermined)
- **StateError** (invalidState, alreadyFinalized, preconditionFailed)
- **ValidationError** (invalidInput, missingField, inputTooLong)
- **GenericError** (for ad-hoc custom messages)

All built-in error types include a `generic` case that accepts a custom `userFriendlyMessage`, allowing for quick additions of edge cases without creating new error types. Use the `GenericError` struct when you want to quickly throw a one-off error without having to define your own type if none of the other fit, useful especially during early phases of development. 

### Usage Examples

```swift
func fetchUserData() throws(DatabaseError) {
    guard isConnected else {
        throw .connectionFailed
    }
    // Fetching logic
}

// Or with classical throws
func processData() throws {
    guard isValid else {
        throw ValidationError.invalidInput(field: "email")
    }
    // Processing logic
}

// Quick error throwing with GenericError
func quickOperation() throws {
    guard condition else {
        throw GenericError(userFriendlyMessage: String(localized: "The condition X was not fulfilled, please check again."))
    }
    // Operation logic
}

// Using generic case for edge cases
func handleSpecialCase() throws(DatabaseError) {
    guard specialCondition else {
        throw .generic(userFriendlyMessage: String(localized: "Database is in maintenance mode"))
    }
    // Special case handling
}
```

## Simplified Error Nesting with the `Catching` Protocol

ErrorKit's `Catching` protocol simplifies error handling in modular applications by providing an elegant way to handle nested error hierarchies. It eliminates the need for explicit wrapper cases while maintaining type safety through typed throws.

### The Problem with Manual Error Wrapping

In modular applications, errors often need to be propagated up through multiple layers. The traditional approach requires defining explicit wrapper cases for each possible error type:

```swift
enum ProfileError: Error {
    case validationFailed(field: String)
    case databaseError(DatabaseError)    // Wrapper case needed
    case networkError(NetworkError)      // Another wrapper case
    case fileError(FileError)           // Yet another wrapper
}

// And manual error wrapping in code:
 do {
     try database.fetch(id)
 } catch let error as DatabaseError {
     throw .databaseError(error)
 }
```

### The Solution: `Catching` Protocol

ErrorKit's `Catching` protocol provides a single `caught` case that can wrap any error, plus a convenient `catch` function for automatic error wrapping:

```swift
enum ProfileError: Throwable, Catching {
    case validationFailed(field: String)
    case caught(Error)  // Single case handles all nested errors!
    
    var userFriendlyMessage: String { /* ... */ }
}

struct ProfileRepository {
    func loadProfile(id: String) throws(ProfileError) {
        // Regular error throwing for validation
        guard id.isValidFormat else {
            throw ProfileError.validationFailed(field: "id")
        }
        
        // Automatically wrap any database or file errors
        let userData = try ProfileError.catch {
            let user = try database.loadUser(id)
            let settings = try fileSystem.readUserSettings(user.settingsPath)
            return UserProfile(user: user, settings: settings)
        }
    }
}
```

Note the `ProfileError.catch` function call, which wraps any errors into the `caught` case and also passes through the return type.

### Built-in Support in ErrorKit Types

All of ErrorKit's built-in error types (`DatabaseError`, `FileError`, `NetworkError`, etc.) already conform to `Catching`, allowing you to easily wrap system errors or other error types:

```swift
func saveUserData() throws(DatabaseError) {
    // Automatically wraps SQLite errors, file system errors, etc.
    try DatabaseError.catch {
        try database.beginTransaction()
        try database.execute(query)
        try database.commit()
    }
}
```

### Adding Catching to Your Error Types

Making your own error types support automatic error wrapping is simple:

1. Conform to the `Catching` protocol
2. Add the `caught(Error)` case to your error type
3. Use the `catch` function for automatic wrapping

```swift
enum AppError: Throwable, Catching {
    case invalidConfiguration
    case caught(Error)  // Required for Catching protocol
    
    var userFriendlyMessage: String {
        switch self {
        case .invalidConfiguration:
            return String(localized: "The app configuration is invalid.")
        case .caught(let error):
            return ErrorKit.userFriendlyMessage(for: error)
        }
    }
}

// Usage is clean and simple:
func appOperation() throws(AppError) {
    // Explicit error throwing for known cases
    guard configFileExists else {
        throw AppError.invalidConfiguration
    }
    
    // Automatic wrapping for system errors and other error types
    try AppError.catch {
        try riskyOperation()
        try anotherRiskyOperation()
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using `Catching`

- **Less Boilerplate**: No need for explicit wrapper cases for each error type
- **Type Safety**: Maintains typed throws while simplifying error handling
- **Clean Code**: Reduces error handling verbosity
- **Automatic Message Propagation**: User-friendly messages flow through the error chain
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing error types
- **Return Value Support**: The `catch` function preserves return values from wrapped operations

### Best Practices

- Use `Catching` for error types that might wrap other errors
- Keep error hierarchies shallow when possible
- Use specific error cases for known errors, `caught` for others
- Preserve user-friendly messages when wrapping errors
- Consider error recovery strategies at each level

The `Catching` protocol makes error handling in Swift more intuitive and maintainable, especially in larger applications with complex error hierarchies. Combined with typed throws, it provides a powerful way to handle errors while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

## Enhanced Error Debugging with Error Chain Description

One of the most challenging aspects of error handling in Swift is tracing where exactly an error originated, especially when using error wrapping across multiple layers of an application. ErrorKit solves this with powerful debugging tools that help you understand the complete error chain.

### The Problem with Traditional Error Logging

When logging errors in Swift, you typically lose context about how an error propagated through your application:

```swift
} catch {
    // ðŸ˜• Only shows the leaf error with no chain information
    Logger().error("Error occurred: \(error)")
    
    // ðŸ˜• Shows a better message but still no error chain
    Logger().error("Error: \(ErrorKit.userFriendlyMessage(for: error))")
    // Output: "Could not find database file."
}
```

This makes it difficult to:
- Understand which module or layer originally threw the error
- Trace the error's path through your application
- Group similar errors for analysis
- Prioritize which errors to fix first

### Solution: Error Chain Description

ErrorKit's `errorChainDescription(for:)` function provides a comprehensive view of the entire error chain, showing you exactly how an error propagated through your application:

```swift
do {
    try await updateUserProfile()
} catch {
    // ðŸŽ¯ Always use this for debug logging
    Logger().error("\(ErrorKit.errorChainDescription(for: error))")
    
    // Output shows the complete chain:
    // ProfileError
    // â””â”€ DatabaseError
    //    â””â”€ FileError.notFound(path: "/Users/data.db")
    //       â””â”€ userFriendlyMessage: "Could not find database file."
}
```

This hierarchical view tells you:
1. Where the error originated (FileError)
2. How it was wrapped (DatabaseError â†’ ProfileError)
3. What exactly went wrong (file not found)
4. The user-friendly message (reported to users)

For errors conforming to the `Catching` protocol, you get the complete error wrapping chain. This is why it's important for your own error types and any Swift packages you develop to adopt both `Throwable` and `Catching` - it not only makes them work better with typed throws but also enables automatic extraction of the full error chain.

Even for errors that don't conform to `Catching`, you still get valuable information since most Swift errors are enums. The error chain description will show you the exact enum case (e.g., `FileError.notFound`), making it easy to search your codebase for the error's origin. This is much better than the default cryptic message you get for enum cases when using `localizedDescription`.

### Error Analytics with Grouping IDs

To help prioritize which errors to fix, ErrorKit provides `groupingID(for:)` that generates stable identifiers for errors sharing the exact same type structure and enum cases:

```swift
struct ErrorTracker {
    static func log(_ error: Error) {
        // Get a stable ID that ignores dynamic parameters
        let groupID = ErrorKit.groupingID(for: error) // e.g. "3f9d2a"
        
        Analytics.track(
            event: "error_occurred",
            properties: [
                "error_group": groupID,
                "error_details": ErrorKit.errorChainDescription(for: error)
            ]
        )
    }
}
```

The grouping ID generates the same identifier for errors that have identical:
- Error type hierarchy
- Enum cases in the chain

But it ignores:
- Dynamic parameters (file paths, field names, etc.)
- User-friendly messages (which might be localized or dynamic)

For example, these errors have the same grouping ID since they differ only in their dynamic path parameters:
```swift
// Both generate groupID: "3f9d2a"
ProfileError
â””â”€ DatabaseError
   â””â”€ FileError.notFound(path: "/Users/john/data.db")
      â””â”€ userFriendlyMessage: "Could not find database file."

ProfileError
â””â”€ DatabaseError
   â””â”€ FileError.notFound(path: "/Users/jane/backup.db")
      â””â”€ userFriendlyMessage: "Die Backup-Datenbank konnte nicht gefunden werden."
```

This precise grouping allows you to:
- Track true error frequencies in analytics without noise from dynamic data
- Create meaningful charts of most common error patterns
- Make data-driven decisions about which errors to fix first
- Monitor error trends over time

### Summary

ErrorKit's debugging tools transform error handling from a black box into a transparent system. By combining `errorChainDescription` for debugging with `groupingID` for analytics, you get deep insight into error flows while maintaining the ability to track and prioritize issues effectively. This is particularly powerful when combined with ErrorKit's `Catching` protocol, creating a comprehensive system for error handling, debugging, and monitoring.
